# aux_workbook
A workbook template used in Programming Fundamentals, Computer Graphics, and Concurrent and Parallel Systems.

The workbook.tex file provides the outline of the LaTeX document.  Two image files are provided to for the logo
that will work depending on your build approach.

Simple use:
1. Just add a .tex file for each chapter / unit of the module.
2. In workbook.tex, add a `/include(filename)` to add to the document.
3. Any additional packages, add them to the header in workbook.tex.
4. Tables of contents and figures will be generated automatically.
